## PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

### Phase 1: Core OOP (IMMEDIATE)
1. Class instantiation (ClassName.new())
2. Method calls on instances
3. Constructor support
4. this/self binding in methods

### Phase 2: Algorithm Support (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Grid type with neighbors()
2. Counter methods (most_common, etc.)
3. Window loop (sliding window)
4. Defer statements

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Converge loop
2. Flood loop
3. Fixed precision type
4. Async basics (race, barrier)

### Phase 4: Enterprise/Production (LOWER PRIORITY)
1. Audit classes
2. Deterministic blocks
3. Component system
4. Import system

## NOTES
- The interpreter already has 200+ built-in functions
- Most basic types are implemented
- For loops have all variants
- Pattern matching works
- Error handling (try/catch) works
- Rich output (colors, tables, animations) works
